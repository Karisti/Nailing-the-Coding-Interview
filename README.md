## 0x01 - Algorithm Definition (quoting wikipedia)

> In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.

> Algorithms have become an important way of optimizing programs in Computer Science. It is rather easy to code a solution to a specific problem. What is more difficult is to have the most efficient algorithm, meaning the algorithm with the [lowest time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).

## 0xFE - Credit
My past interview assessments with different financial companies (BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Murex etc.) were what got me started into algorithms and competitive programming.  

I want to thank my Friends of 42 School in Paris, especially Iwan Burel (iburel) and Steven Toupin (stoupin), for their precious insights and outstanding problem solving skills.  

The various internet sites like Codingame, Leetcode, Hackerrank and Codility were helpful to read about new algorithm problems.  

Last, I want to thank the numerous quidam on github and stackoverflow who raised my knowledge of algorithm resolution using assembly language
