* Prime Numbers related Algorithms
* Binary Search Algorithms, allowing a logarithmic search of a special number in a sorted array
* Greedy Algorithms

**Definition of Algorithm**

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks. wikipedia

Algorithms have become an important way of optimizing programs in Computer Science. It is rather easy to code a solution to a specific problem. What is more difficult is to have the most efficient algorithm, meaning the algorithm with the lowest time complexity.

What is time complexity ?
In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor. Time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation, typicallyO(n),​{\displaystyle O(n\log n),}​{\displaystyle O(n^{\alpha }),}​{\displaystyle O(2^{n}),} etc., where n is the input size in units of bits needed to represent the input.
